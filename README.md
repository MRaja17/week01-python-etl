## Intermediate 2: ETL + scikit-learn
Trained a simple Logistic Regression model on `output/students_clean.csv` and saved results to `output/model_result.txt`.
## Hard 1: Optimization
Used vectorized pandas operations, removed duplicates, standardized columns, and logged outputs to validate ETL transformations.
## Hard 2: End-to-End Mini Project
Built an end-to-end pipeline:
1. Toy ETL (`toy_etl.py`)
2. Real dataset ETL (`students_etl.py`)
3. Model training (`students_ml.py`)
Outputs are stored in the `output/` directory.
